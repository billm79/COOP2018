# Program Description
#   This program takes user input (equation of curve, x value for point on curve)
#   and determines the slope of the curve at that point.
#
# Algorithm (pseudocode)
#   Introduce program
#   Get equation of curve from user (e.g. 3 * x ^ 2 + 2 * x + 20)
#   Parse equation to get degree and coefficients (expand this)
#   Use a "small" âˆ†x to get two points on curve bounding point entered by user (expand this)
#   Calculate slope using those two points (slope = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1))

            # find coefficient
            j = x_loc
            while j > 0:
                # if this character is an operator, stop looking for coefficient
                if is_contained_in(expr[j-1], ['+', '-']):
                    break
