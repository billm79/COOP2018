#
# Program Description
#   This tests functions written in other programs. The function must not print. It must return a single value.
#   The value can be of any type, including lists containing multiple values of differing types. So, if your
#   function needs to return multiple values, put them in a list or tuple.
#
# How to use
#   • Import the function to be tested from your program file
#   • Copy/paste testTemplate()
#   • Edit the copy
#       • change its name
#       • change the results.append... line to refer to your function in your program. Include necessary parameters.
#       • change the expected result
#       • copy/paste the results.append... line several times, once for each case you want to test.
#       • edit the parameters and expected result for each case.
#   change the function_to_call at the bottom to the test function you created here
#   run this program
