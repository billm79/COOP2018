# Program Description
#   Adds a addGrade() method to Student to facilitate adding grades
#   and credit hours for several courses, then calculates GPA on
#   the total hours and quality points.
#
# Algorithm (pseudocode)
#   introduce program
#   get students name
#   create student object with 0 hours and 0 quality points
#   loop to get hours and grade for each course
#   print GPA
