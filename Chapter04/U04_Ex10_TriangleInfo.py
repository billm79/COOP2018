# Program Description
#   Draws a triangle between three mouse clicks and
#   displays information about the triangle
#
# Algorithm (pseudocode)
#   Create GraphWin
#   Set window coordinates for graphing (-10, -10, 10, 10)
#   Print introduction & instructions
#   Wait for mouse click to continue
#   Draw graph with a call to U04_Ex07_CircleIntersection.drawAxes()
#   Get first mouse click with prompt using U04_Ex08_LineSegmentInfo.getMouseClick()
#   Get second mouse click with prompt using U04_Ex08_LineSegmentInfo.getMouseClick()
#   Get third mouse click with prompt using U04_Ex08_LineSegmentInfo.getMouseClick()
#   Draw triangle between three mouse clicks
#   Print perimeter and area of the triangle
#   Wait for mouse click to close
