# Program Description
#   Draws an archery target in which the center is yellow surrounded by concentric
#   rings of red, blue, black, and white. Each ring has the same width, which is
#   the same as the radius of the center circle.
#
# Algorithm (pseudocode)
#   Create a GraphWin
#   Define a list with five circle objects
#   The radius of each successive circle is the next integer multiple of the center circle.
#   Draw circles, starting from the outside.
