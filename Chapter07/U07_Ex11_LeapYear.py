# Program Description
#   Function that calculates if a given year is a leap year. Returns boolean.
#
# Algorithm (pseudocode)
#   introduce program
#   create a list with sample data with which to test
#   for each element in list call isLeapYear() with element as parameter
#   print results
#   
#   isLeapYear():
#       y is argument
#       if y is divisible by 4 and not century year divisble by 400, return true
#       otherwise, return false

    for year in years:
