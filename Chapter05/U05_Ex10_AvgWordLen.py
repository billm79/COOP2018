# Program Description
#   Calculates the average word length in a sentence
#   entered by the user
#
# Algorithm (pseudocode)
#   Print intro
#   Get sentence from user
#   Split sentence into words
#   Accumulate total length of words (stripping non-letters)
#   Divide by number of words to get average word length
#   Print results
